#### Download Android Studio
The first step is to download Android studio. If you already have this downloaded you can go ahead and skip to the next part.
   1. Visit https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html and click “Download Android Studio”.
   2. Follow the instructions in the installer to finish the installation process

#### Setting Up
You will first need to setup your Android Device to enable USB debugging as a Developer.

Enable USB debugging in the Developer options as follows.
First, you must enable the developer options:
   1. Open the Settings app.
   2. (Only on Android 8.0 or higher) Select System.
   3. Scroll to the bottom and select About phone.
   4. Scroll to the bottom and tap Build number 7 times.
   5. Return to the previous screen to find Developer options near the bottom.
  
Open Developer options, and then scroll down to find and enable USB debugging.

Now connect your device to your development machine with a USB cable. If you're developing on Windows, you might need to install the appropriate USB driver for your device.

   1. In Android Studio, click the app module in the Project window and then select Run > Run (or click Run  in the toolbar).
